# AI Fight Pits

AI Fight Pits is a web application that uses GPT-3, a state-of-the-art AI model by OpenAI, to narrate a battle between two characters of your choice.

The application prompts the user to enter the names of two characters and, on submission, uses the GPT-3 model to generate a vivid and detailed description of a single round fight between the two characters.

The AI not only describes the fight but also concludes with the winner and provides a compelling explanation based on the implied capabilities of the two opponents.

This project was bootstrapped with Create T3 App, a modern full-stack development environment for building scalable, type-safe and performant web applications.

Try it out [here](https://ai-fight-pits.vercel.app/).

## Usage

1. Go to [https://ai-fight-pits.vercel.app/](https://ai-fight-pits.vercel.app/)
2. Enter the names of two characters in the provided input fields.
3. Click "Submit" and wait for the AI to generate the fight narration.
4. Enjoy the thrilling narrative generated by the AI!

## Development

The application uses the T3 stack, which includes Next.js for the front end, tRPC for type-safe API routes, Prisma for database access, NextAuth.js for authentication, and tailwindcss for styling.

You need an OpenAI API key to interact with the GPT-3 model. The key is stored in an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
